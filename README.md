# Automate-sending-daily-email-reports
***This Python script automates sending daily email reports using the smtplib and email libraries. It connects to an SMTP server, formats the email with a subject, body, and optional attachment, and then sends it to a designated recipient. You can schedule the script to run daily using cron on Linux/Mac or Task Scheduler on Windows, making it ideal for automating routine reporting tasks. The script is configurable with your email details and includes basic error handling for reliability.***
